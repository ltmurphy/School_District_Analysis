# School District Analysis

## Overview of School District Analysis:
### The purpose of this analysis was to examine multiple school districts on different key points using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook while compensating for academic dishonesty. Various DataFrames will be used to isolate the specific data deemed fraudulent, in this case the math and reading scores from Thomas High School's 9th grade. This data is then removed from the DataFrame to allow for a more accurate depiction of the district levels. The remaing scores for the 9th and those for the other grades are then evaluated against school spending, size, and type.

## Results:
   * How is the district summary affected?

   * How is the school summary affected?
   * How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
   * How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
   * Math and reading scores by grade
   *Scores by school spending
   *Scores by school size
   *Scores by school typed
